# Stacks, queues, deques, lists

# Items are ordered depending on how they are added or removed
# Items added stay in position relative to other elements before and after

# Linear structures have two ends:
# left & right
# front & rear
# top & bottom

# Linear structures are differentiated by how/where items are added and removed
